# Advanced JavaScript: Objects and Functions

* Everything is an Object: Inheritance and the Prototype Chain
  
  * Primitives:(Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, Null)
  * Objects: (Arrays, Functions, Objects, Dates, Wrappers for Numbers, Strings, Booleans)
  * Inheritance is when one object is based on another object
  * Javascript is a protype based-language. Each object has a prototype property.
  * Each object is part of a bigger Object that has its own methods.
  
  * Protype Chain: When a certain method (or property) is called, 
  the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found, the search moves on to
  the object's prototype. This continues until the method is found: **prototype chain**.
